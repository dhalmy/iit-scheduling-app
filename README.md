# iitschedulingapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

# IPro 497 – Product Design Document

## Problem statement
Problem statement 1: Students can select their major, year, and class requirements so that an app can recommend classes for the student to take in that semester, potentially using AI to cater to the student.

Problem statement 2: IIT students can use an intuitive application, using their major, year, and class requirements to automatically generate a course schedule given their major and certain manually set preferences.

Problem statement 3: IIT students can use an intuitive application to automatically generate a course schedule given their major and certain manually set preferences.

- We will use Github for version control. Team-members will push their finished code to a branch to ensure the main branch remains bug-free.
- If we need to meet outside of class we have found a mutually agreeable time at:
- If we need to meet outside of class we will use the following tool/tech for meetings:
- When we are not meeting together we will use the following tool/tech for communications:

### Requested Approach/Behavior 
##### Examples (edit and add your own)
